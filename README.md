# Car Sharing System

We are required to develop a web/mobile application for a company running a car share scheme. The company owns a number of cars which can be parked at a number of locations in the city. Users of the scheme will take a car for some period of time, use it and then return it to an empty location. The system needs to provide the necessary transactions and data management to support this kind of business.
The system must: 
* Register users
* Keep all car data and rental information
* Provide a way for a user to book (and return) a car for a particular time and location
* Have an option to find the nearest available car based on the user’s location
* Provide a report for users to see their past bookings with date, time and location information
* Be platform independent and work through web, or any mobile platform.
* Have enough dummy data to test user scenarios in different locations and with different cars
